## 🛠️ Technical Breakdown & Workflow

Live Demo Site: https://kala-cafe.netlify.app/

This project was built using an **AI-Assisted Development** workflow. Rather than traditional manual coding, I acted as the **System Architect**, using **Cursor AI** to orchestrate the build process.

This project showcases a modern, responsive website for Kala Cafe, a cafe located at 141 Reclamation Street, Yau Ma Tei, Hong Kong. The site features a detailed menu, customer testimonials, contact form, and Google Maps integration.

### 🧠 The AI-Native Workflow
* **Rapid Prototyping:** I leveraged Cursor's **Composer** to scaffold the multi-page architecture (Home, Menu, Contact) in minutes, focusing my time on UX/UI design rather than boilerplate code.
* **Context-Aware Engineering:** Used the `@Codebase` feature to ensure CSS styling remained consistent across the entire project without manual repetition.
* **Iterative Refinement:** Every piece of AI-generated code was manually reviewed and refactored for performance, accessibility (A11y), and clean semantic HTML structure.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- FormSubmit (for contact form)

### 🚀 Performance & Optimization
* **Lighthouse Scores:** Optimized for 90+ scores across Performance and SEO.
* **Responsive Design:** Implemented a "Mobile-First" strategy using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
* **Deployment:** Integrated a **CI/CD pipeline** via GitHub and Netlify for instant global deployment.

### 💡 Key Learnings
* Mastered **Prompt Engineering** for front-end development (logic-based prompting vs. descriptive prompting).
* Learned to debug complex JavaScript filter logic by interacting with AI-led "Code Reviews."
